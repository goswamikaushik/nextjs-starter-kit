## Summary for AI agents

Next.js 16.2.4 + React 19 frontend boilerplate (App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, Redux Toolkit). Dev server: `pnpm dev` at `http://localhost:3000`. This version has breaking changes from Next.js ≤15 — middleware is `src/proxy.ts`, not `middleware.ts`.

Full context in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) including:

- **Middleware is `src/proxy.ts`** — do not create or edit `middleware.ts`
- **Redux store is empty** — all slices commented out; `useAppSelector` returns nothing until slices are added
- **Auth forms are UI scaffolding only** — no backend, no submit handlers wired up
- **React Compiler is enabled** — never add `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo`
- **All routes must go through `SITE_ROUTES`** in `src/constants/index.ts`

## Autonomy guidance

### Requires human review BEFORE executing

- Changes to `src/proxy.ts` (middleware) — affects every request
- Adding env vars — requires Zod schema update in `src/lib/env.ts` and deployment config
- Changing Redux persist config — can corrupt browser-persisted state
- Modifying `SITE_ROUTES` — cascades to metadata, robots.txt, sitemap.xml
- Changing provider nesting in `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx`

### Safe for autonomous execution

- New chart components in `src/components/{type}-charts/`
- New pages following thin-shell + feature-component pattern
- Styling changes (Tailwind classes, CSS variables)
- Adding Redux slices inside `appReducer` in `src/redux/store.ts`
- Bug fixes with narrow, clear scope

---

## Workflow

```bash
pnpm check-types   # TypeScript type check
pnpm lint          # ESLint
pnpm build         # Full production build (also runs lint + type-check)
```

---

## Manual command rule

**NEVER run code generation, schema pulls, type generation, migrations, or any build step the developer should control. Stop and tell the user the exact command to run.**

- Add shadcn component: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Type-check: `pnpm check-types`
- Full build: `pnpm build`
